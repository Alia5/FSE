# FSE #

FSE is a (work in progress) cross platform 2D-Toolkit built on top of SFML and Box2D which could be used for Games and alike.

FSE is mainly created as a side project out of personal interest.

I only have limited knowledge about game- / engine-programming and thus, this is probably not the most well though out code there is. 
I wouldn't recommend using it. If you'd really like to however, it's licensed under MIT, so feel free.

FSE supports networking which in testing performed pretty well under pretty bad network conditions (~200ms Ping with some packet loss) with a few 100 objects

I'm quite happy with with the results so far, considering this essentially being a little "Sunday project"

It also sports a pretty neat lighting system incl. normal and specular-maps

FSE can also trace any sprite (with alpha channel) and output triangulated convex polys for use with the physics engine.

*Work in Progress*
